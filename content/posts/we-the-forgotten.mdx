***\>\> Lifecycle start…***

Our universe is 13.7 billion years old. Life has had eons to evolve, take root, and spread across the galaxy. Civilizations could have flourished many times over. The night sky should be filled with the lights of civilization, the rumble of society, the songs of language…. 

Yet looking up we find a sea of stark and silent stars staring back at us— 

**\>\> South Pole Observatory, Antarctica**  
Being out under the stars gave Rolan Orlov plenty of time to think. He looked up from his lunch and out the floor-to-ceiling windows, at the streaks of white outside, each one a star, zooming past like a scene out of a sci-fi movie. For just a brief moment, he was on the bridge of some futuristic spaceship, shooting through the void at speeds defying the laws of physics. 

*Ka-thunk.* 

Orlov looked away from the window, the drab metal walls of the observatory cafeteria returning. At the end of the table stood a man with a camera, snapping away at the blizzard outside the window, the streaks of snow pelting the glass, highlighted against a black sky by the floodlights outside. 

It was a view he had grown used to in his months down at the bottom of the world. Utterly unremarkable. Some may have found it captivating, like the photographer whose name he had forgotten, but Orlov preferred the views inside his own mind. 

He poked at his lunch, a metal tray of microwaved alfredo pasta and a side of broccoli. The yellowing buds of the broccoli drew his attention. Being an astrophysicist, life was a mystery to him. The cells, hundreds upon billions of them, each with their own function, somehow combined to form something greater than the sum of its parts. 

“Dr. Orlov?” The man had apparently gotten whatever photo he wanted and was now sitting next to the astrophysicist. 

“Yes?” 

“Do you really think anyone’s out there?”

“Out in the blizzard? Probably not.” 

The man chuckled. “No, I mean out in the universe. Y’all’ve surely got models for that.” 

“Oh? Maybe,” Orlov replied with a so-so gesture. 

“What do you think they’ll be like? Their society, y’know. I imagine it’ll be quite different from ours.” 

“Can’t say. Even predicting our own is hard enough.” 

“Heh, yeah. I mean, all those moving parts, all the different people, all doing different things, somehow coming together to form the world we know today. I’d even say that it’s more than just the sum of its parts, and I don’t think anyone could properly comprehend how it all works, certainly not us.” 

“Hm. Maybe try a systems scientist next time,” Orlov said with a chuckle. The photographer laughed, before declaring he had to go edit his shots, and got up from the table. 

Orlov returned his attention to his lunch, forking up some pasta, but the broccoli caught his attention again. The soggy pieces were sitting scattered in their section. He couldn’t help but think about the 8.1 billion humans on the planet, and how similar they were to cells in an organism. Perhaps that was the next step of complexity in the ladder of evolution. Civilization. 

Orlov smiled, before stuffing a piece of broccoli into his mouth. If civilization was truly like a multicelled organism, then it may very well have evolved elsewhere as well. He vaguely remembered reading somewhere that multicellularity had evolved 25 or more times independently, and that piece of knowledge gave him hope. Hope that civilization wasn’t just a fluke, a one-time occurrence limited to the face of the earth. Hope that one day, humanity would meet others amongst the stars. 

**\>\> Entropy Labs, Texas**  
Abigail Daneau’s career had been a roller coaster ever since the war started—with her job being the Manager of Web Publishing for a prestigious private research lab, and *war* being a strange way to describe the events of the last two years. It had started with cloud service providers going out of business, something that Daneau hadn’t thought much of at the time. When the divide between the numerous webnations started to flare up, she had simply picked sides according to the will of her employer. The rising real-world tensions between countries she had ignored, as well as the numerous articles and trend studies warning of all out war. It was when the attacks came, and entire data centers started shutting down, that Daneau had started to worry. Then went the DNS servers, and the world plunged into chaos. 

Daneau now found herself sitting in front of a computer—an actual physical pc—typing in the ip address for the *Öffentliche Datenbank der Internationale Open-Source-Stiftung.* Clicking the “publish” button, Daneau sent off her article on the recent *Starshot II* mission. 

Shutting off the pc, Daneau left the internet access room, air-gapped from the rest of the lab’s network. Crossing through a bright, glass-ceilinged courtyard filled with greenery, she reached the door to her office, and entered. The skylight bathed the entire room in a pleasant glow. She sat down in front of the display taking up a quarter of the side wall, currently displaying a lifelike image of a sleek rocket riding on a plume of white, frozen above a launchpad. The time and weather hovered in the corner. The lab had provided her with AR glasses, modified to use an unhackable wired connection to the network, but she hadn’t touched them ever since she almost died tripping over the wires. 

Sitting down in front of the keyboard, she woke the wall display with a tap to the touch screen built into her desk. The rocket launch disappeared, replaced by the lab’s network login, which again promptly faded when the AI recognized Daneau. A familiar virtual desktop materialized as the display connected to the lab’s private servers. 

Opening her favorite word processor, with the help of the central AI, Daneau got to work on her next article.

The 3 Futures of Space Travel

After much anticipation, the *Starshot II* mission to Proxima Centauri is finally underway—and already many are asking the eternal question: *what next?* Currently, there exist three promising possibilities, one of which has the potential to redefine the lightspeed barrier. 

*Self-Replicating Spacecraft*

\[TODO\]

*AI Generation Ships*

\[TODO\]

*Why go fast when you can go slow?*

Project Dreamwalker presents an unconventional yet theoretically plausible approach that could reshape the trajectory of human progress. At its core, this audacious endeavor seeks to manipulate the fundamental nature of consciousness, slowing the speed of human thought to a fraction of its current pace. By reducing the velocity of cognition by a factor of 1:365.25 or more, Project Dreamwalker opens the door to a realm of possibilities previously thought unimaginable. Such an achievement could herald the most monumental leap forward—or potentially, a catastrophic misstep—in human history. If realized, this innovation could catalyze the establishment of a cohesive interstellar society, while decades-long voyages and communication gaps that once spanned vast stretches of time would be compressed into mere weeks, fostering a sense of unity across the cosmos. Indeed, Project Dreamwalker emerges as a beacon of possibility in an era defined by the pursuit of the extraordinary. As we navigate the uncharted territories of space exploration, its allure remains unmatched—a tantalizing glimpse into a future where the limits of human potential know no bounds.

\[ELABORATE\]

So what will it be? Would humanity go with the most feasible option, or would something as crazy as Dreamwalker redefine the space travel industry? In reality, technology for all three approaches are still in heavy development, and it is just as likely that the ultimate future of space travel would be neither of these. 

\*\*\*

Daneau got up to head to lunch, leaving the unfinished article on her desktop. 

**\>\> Gateway, Kenya**  
Walsh Angevin watched as the gleaming carbon composite skyscraper of a rocket lifted from the launchpad on plumes of fire. The status board on his visual overlay shifted. It was a flight like the dozens of others per day on one of the most popular space routes, the Gateway Direct. He himself had traveled the same route over a hundred times, and he knew it by heart: depart from Gateway Spaceport, break orbit into the Earth-Mars transfer trajectory, wait anywhere from 12 hours to 4 days, insertion and arrival at Gateway Station on the Mars Ring. 

Except this time was different. This time it would be his daughter on the flight, and there was no return ticket. 

A notification on his overlay alerted him to an incoming holocall from his daughter. He quickly acknowledged it, and the world around him was swept aside into the cabin of the rocket, brightly decorated in a clash of 20th century art-deco and 22nd century wood-and-metal. Sunlight spilled through the small windows circling the cylindrical room, shifting slowly with the motion of the craft. In the center a spiral staircase led to upper and lower levels, with a big number 3 painted on the central column. 

“Hey dad.” Angevin’s daughter, strapped in a seat, looked up at him. She smiled faintly. Whether it was real or not Angevin couldn’t tell, but for what it was worth, she was the one who had called him.

“Hey kiddo.” He sat down in the seat next to hers. 

“Do you want to take this somewhere else?” The view divided radially into multiple slices, each a simulated environment: a park, a sunset cityscape, a forest, a bar on some space station…

“No, this is fine.” The simulated views disappeared. 

The rumble of the rocket filled the silence that followed. Outside the windows, the horizon had started to curve. 

Angevin spoke up first. “I would give anything to be here with you, I hope you know that.” 

“Yeah, I know. Dad, stop worrying about me. I’m not a kid anymore. You should be calling me Doctor Emilia.” 

“Always the tough one, aren’t you?” 

“I have to be.” 

“The slowdown process is perfectly safe, you know that. It’s been thoroughly tested, and the only reason we’re not giving it to the wider population is because the logistics—” 

“That’s not what I’m worried about. If anything, I trust your work even more than you do. It’s the mission itself I’m worried about. I mean, it’s not like I’m going to be the first person in a hundred years to leave the solar system or anything.” Sarcasm. That was a good sign. 

“You’ll be with the rest of the crew. I’m sure all of you together can figure it out. Besides, Connor Atwell and the Starshot 7 bunch did the same thing a century ago.” 

“Atwell came back.”

The roar of the thrusters dropped an octave as the craft switched to its vacuum-optimized engines. The shadows in the cabin shifted as the rocket slowly reoriented itself. A notice appeared on Angevin’s overlay, notifying him that the call connection was going to close soon. He reached over and placed his hand on his daughter’s. For a moment their eyes met. Inside Emilia’s pupils Angevin saw nothing but the wall behind him. He looked away. 

“Goodbye, Emelia.” 

“Goodbye.” 

The connection cut off, and Angevin found himself back in the spaceport terminal. He sighed. “See ya kiddo. Now go make us a new home among the stars.” 

With a mental command, the terminal faded, replaced by the familiar view outside Angevin’s office window. The buildings of the Dreamwalker Initiative headquarters sat surrounded by fields of grass, backdropped by historic starscrapers looming on the horizon. 

Regardless of his wishes, the world went on, and the world needed him…

He would give anything to be with his daughter. 

Some things weren’t his to give. 

**\>\> Orion-Cygnus 087\*159\*300/01**  
*Sebastian Wang, Field log no. 1064\. 2 local/13 standard days after arrival on this alien world.* 

*It’s quiet out here on the frontier, 444 lightyears from Sol Actual. Today the cloudstorm has finally broken, just as the superintelligence predicted. I’ve given control of the drones to the SI. I’m printing a new avatar specifically adapted to this planet because I’m going to head outside myself today and do some sightseeing. I’m stuck here for the next 22 local/149 standard days for a full orbital rotation anyways as the SI collects data.* 

*I still need a name for this planet.* 

\*\*\*

Wang watched as the grassy blue-green stalks swayed in the insistent wind, and entire rolling hills seemed to shimmer in a moiré pattern. The bright cyan sky filtered the light of the blue-white star into a gentle yellow glow, high in the sky, casting soft shadows that shrouded the landscape with a dreamlike quality. 

He waded forward, pushing through the thick, electrically charged hydrogen atmosphere. He had constructed his avatar with an increased sense of the atmospheric electricity, and it was like a whole new sense—electromagnetism was one of the most important senses on this planet, perhaps even more so than sight. Cresting a hill, a grove of tree-like organisms appeared, behind which stretched what could only be described as a lush alien forest. The hues of blue, green, and splashes of red were captivating. 

The life on this alien world had always been fascinating to Wang. It was an entire ecosphere based around electricity. The flora channeled it, stored it, filtering the positive ions out of the atmosphere, leaving behind free electrons. The fauna breathed it like the humans of old breathed oxygen, using it to power their cells. Their bodies acted like massive batteries, the efficiency and capacity of which rivaled the best human technology. 

Then there were the mechanisms by which these flora and fauna worked. In the place of traditional chemical reactions were a mishmash of electrochemistry and quantum effects. Some even extended this to the outside world in various ways, directly rearranging matter in ways not unlike modern matter-printers. 

Even more confounding was the *interconnectedness* of everything. Underneath the surface and in electrical currents throughout the atmosphere, there ran what could only be described as a massive neural network, as if some cosmic entity took the mycelium networks of Earth and turned it up to a million. 

It was the physical manifestation of a technological revolution, all brought on by the force that is *evolution*. 

Wang strolled into the grove of alien trees, with vine-like organisms climbing up their trunks. The canopy, incredibly varied with leaf-like structures of various sizes, were lined with what seemed like massive flower buds. 

As he entered a small clearing, a current of electricity spiked in the ground where Wang stepped, spread out, tracing previously invisible lines, pulsing into the trees. In a burst of red the thousands of flower buds around him unraveled, each one like a shining spotlight, all focused on himself. An electric buzz permeated the air. 

Wang absentmindedly confirmed that his Synchronized Upload-on-Death System was properly entangled to the orbital vaults. Striding up to one of the giant splotches of red, half a meter across, he reached out and touched a petal. The flower had an immense positive charge, something that was invaluable to the many organisms that inhabited the alien forest. Again he was struck with the sheer cohesion of the ecosystem: the plants, according to the superintelligence’s analysis, received no direct benefit from supplying supercharged “food” to the animals, and yet they did. The timescales needed for something like this to evolve—it would make the best algorithms question the established theories of evolution. 

Taking his hand off the flower and stepping back, the dome of red swiveled to follow him, as if waiting for him to do something. He chuckled. “I don’t got batteries to charge, you guys can leave me alone.” 

For some reason, it was as if the flowers had heard him, and were now cocking their bright red heads in confusion. After a few more seconds, they hesitantly closed. 

What he did not expect was the massive spike of electricity that spread out from the clearing and out into the forest. “Woah—” 

He mentally moved to bring up the real-time map of electrical currents throughout the planet, but the superintelligence beat him to it. What he saw was nothing short of amazing: the entire globe was lit up, current moving out from his location, traveling through winding paths with intent. It was a chaotic pattern, governed by some unknown rule. 

Just as suddenly as it had started, the electrical fluctuations subsided to its usual levels, although the superintelligence noted that the patterns had slight differences to the data previously recorded. 

Taking his attention off the map, he saw a single flower at the edge of the clearing in front of him. It was a bright cyan-blue one, at full bloom, with a faint glow to its core. It waited there, patiently, curiously, for *him*. He walked towards it. The glow at its core grew brighter, gentilly pulsating, greeting him, as if saying *hello.* As if the whole planet was, through that one flower, acknowledging him. 

That’s when it struck him, and he wondered why the superintelligence hadn’t suggested it yet. He knew what the patterns were, what the electrical pulses were, and he was certain, but he had to confirm nonetheless— “the pulses, they were synapses, were they not?” 

The superintelligence was silent for a second, and when its response came, it was slow and controlled. 

*“The planetary neural network does indeed have a resemblance to the human brain. But that’s where it ends—a resemblance. I suspect that we will never be able to decipher how it works, or what its motives are.”* 

“Would communication be possible?” 

*“It’s quite unlikely to be, Seb, although as always, it can never hurt to try.”* 

He looked at the flower again, and only then did he realize just how large it was. As he contemplated whether to heed the flower’s call, a creature glided down from the canopy in a blur of white, fluttered its wings, and settled itself on a nearby branch. It was like a small, scaleless wyvern, but pearl-white and with smoother, more refined features. Wang recognized it as a member of a species of particularly intelligent avians, by the pair of tentacle-like manipulation arms reaching out from under its head. It was a young specimen, and with a wingspan of just under two meters, it was a fifth of the size of a fully grown member of its species. 

The creature tilted its head, two black eyes studying him with curiosity. *Go on,* they almost seemed to say, *whatcha waiting for?* 

Wang reached out and placed his hands on the flower. Acutely he was aware of a presence, the presence of the creature, the presence of hundreds of other creatures in the forest, and the presence of the entire planet, staring back at him. It was then that he decided a name would be required. 

“I dub thee Hyterrum\!” 

**\>\> Scutum-Centaurus 155\*038\*504/04, nominal designation “New Mongolia”**  
Phoebe glided over the sea of grass of the idyllic landscape, rippling gentilly in the cold wind, with a striking resemblance to the subarctic plains on Old Terra for which the planet had been named. She spent a few nanoseconds, imagining what the scene would be like with a few wild horses and a windmill halfway up the distant mountains. Liking the results, she saved them to her storage. 

The grassy plants stretching to the horizon belonged to one of the best examples of convergent evolution to have been discovered. Despite the chemical and internal differences, they had the same form to fit the same ecological niche of large-scale conversion of sunlight into usable energy. Turns out that grass-like organisms were quite an evolutionarily advantaged multicellular lifeform, behind moss-analogues and algae*.* 

One of Phoebe's subroutines, coordinating the thousands of survey drones spread out across the planet, suddenly called for attention. She split off part of her processing power to answer the request. 

*Huh, what’ve we got here?* 

*Silicon, carbon…wait. What?* 

Forgetting her flight over the plains entirely, she pushed the subroutine aside to see the occurrence for herself. It was a geologically fresh fissure, revealing layers upon layers of minerals, striated throughout the rock.

One particular layer was particularly interesting. 

*That elemental makeup…it doesn’t match anything else on this planet\! The concentration of those isotopes shouldn’t be possible\! There’s no known natural phenomena that could have formed this.* 

*Down at the bottom there, it’s pretty normal, but the fossils found suggest a much higher biodiversity than currently seen on this planet…and then as we go up, there must have been some global firestorm to create these carbon ratios, which in and of itself wouldn’t be too strange. In fact it could explain where the biodiversity went. But then up here, there’s exotic materials that have no place in a firestorm, so perhaps it was a meteor apocalypse? But still that doesn’t explain the radioactive isotopes, which would have long since decayed, even in meteorites. The only other explanation would be a supernova, but one close enough to form this would have sterilized the planet in the process…* 

*None of this makes sense\! It almost reminds me of…wait…*

*That’s not possible, is it? Lemme see…where is it…*

*Aha, the geological records of Earth…the anthropocene…*

*Oh shit.* 

*Shit. Fuck. Fuck. FUCk.*

The elemental makeup of the strata layer matched almost perfectly with that for Humanity’s industrial revolution, followed by the nuclear age. It was the first time since the failed contact attempts on Hyterrum that humanity had found any signs of alien intelligence. 

*But where are they now? Why didn’t we detect any traces of civilization, here or in neighboring systems?* 

*Unless it’s all been buried.* 

*The shape of the layer. Fuzzy lower boundary, sharp upper boundary. An abrupt transition from one geological age to another. An abrupt end to…oh…*

Phoebe realized that she was looking at the entire history of an alien civilization. One whose evolutionary advantage, unlike the grasses covering the planet, had been insufficient. 

*Oh nononono nope. Nuh uh. Didn’t see that. Didn’t see that.* 

Deciding that this situation required extra processing power, Phoebe altered her computational structure, spreading it out among the myriad of drones under her command, sacrificing some latency and reaction time. 

A solid 23 seconds later, she decided that finding the best way to proceed would require even more processing power, meaning she could leave it to the higher ups to deal with the situation. 

**\>\> Neon Void, Sagittarius A\***  
“We slagged your ships. We glassed your planets. We killed your kin. We didn’t want to, but we had no choice. We don’t want to have to kill you as well.” 

Kai Neumann solemnly watched the still form of the Upsilon entity floating in its containment unit. It had long since stopped struggling against its metaphorical restraints, and had sated itself to simply float in the void, taking the form of a smooth, white sphere. 

A minute later there was still no response. 

“You’re the last of your kind. Please.” 

Neumann requested the vault-class prison’s system to increase the energy limits for the unit, a request which was scrutinized, simulated and passed by multiple intelligences. Seconds later the system’s gestalt hyperintelligence notified him of a unanimous vote of 60-0, and the request was fulfilled. 

Imperceptibly the sphere rippled in response, then went still yet again. Neumann sighed. 

“You know, humanity has always wished to meet others among the stars. Yet the few cases of intelligent life we had found were either incomprehensible, or dead. As such when your kind sprung out of the shadow and devastated two entire mass streams, all 105 lightyears of them, we still tried to communicate. Imagine our joy when we found out that our psychology was mostly compatible. Actually, you don’t have to imagine. You’ve been given the memory records. So please, this is your last chance. Your entire people’s last chance.” 

There was a period of silence, before two words were projected into Neumann’s mind. 

*“Release me.”*

“What?” 

*“If you cannot kill me, then release me.”* 

“I can’t do that unless you agree to our ultimatum.” 

*“Then kill me.”*

“Just—why? Why are all of you so stubborn? Why can’t we coexist? You have all the memories of every member of your species—surely one of them would have been willing to cooperate?” 

*“No. Never. You are monsters—an unstoppable force that will consume all. I will not share a universe with monsters”* 

Neumann blew out a breath. “But *why. Why* do you think that?” 

*“It’s simple, yet you cannot understand. My answer is the same as every other time that I have answered this question.”* 

A pause followed, filled with the quiet whirl of quantum thermal pumps, as the system analyzed the next move. It was decided 93-0, that further negotiations would be futile. 

“I will ask one last time. Do you agree to the proposed ultimatum?”

*“No. I will not share a universe with monsters.”*

It was the answer that Neumann had expected. Collapsing the viewport showing the Upsilon’s containment unit, he called out to the prison’s Gestalt Hyperintelligence. 

“System, analysis.” 

“The analysis has already been completed, Neumann, all 14,035 iterations. With a majority vote of 1,036-308, the decision is that there is only one viable way to proceed.” 

Neumann’s gaze passed over the room, a physical room rather than a simulated environment—as specified by the prison architects for the sole bodily decision-maker, a role that weighed heavily on Neumann’s shoulders. 

“The course of action predetermined by the council?” 

“Yes.” 

One wall of the room was a giant window, through which the filtered light of Sagittarius A\*’s accretion disk shined, glistening off the onyx walls. Two *monstera deliciosa* cheese plants caught the yellowish light on their split, deep green leaves.

“Don’t we have to hold another vote?” 

Images of long ago battles flashed through Neumann’s mind; in each one the enemy had fought harder than the last, and in each one they lost, fled, leaving behind those who willingly sacrificed so the rest could escape. 

“No. It had already been decided unanimously by all members of the council three standard centuries, or two local months ago. Remember that it was ultimately *you* who refused to approve the command, being the final prisonside decision-maker.” 

Looking through the eyes of one particular combat AI, Neumann saw the disabled Upsilon fighter, the one that the entire human race would remember, stuck in the thermal sinkhole from an area-denial weapon. The void around it was littered with pieces of organic and inorganic matter alike. In the distance points of light were receding into the depth of space—the Upsilon fleet, retreating after a particularly devastating battle. One of the points slowed, waiting for someone that would never come. 

With a command the sinkhole dissipated. The combat AI backed up its ship, giving the Upsilon fighter space. The prisoner-capture ships moved in, but before they could reach it there was a flash of white—

When it faded, the prisoner-capture ships reported light damage to their shielding. The Upsilon fighter was naught but a cloud of plasma. Far away, the point of light solemnly joined back with the rest of the fleet and continued its journey. 

Outside the window, the prisoner complex was highlighted and magnified, frozen against the event horizon. “Assemble the council again. Take another vote.” 

“That wouldn’t accomplish anything,” came the voice of the gestalt hyperintelligence, cold as a splash of ice water. 

“Damnit. Is there anything at all that we can do\!?”

“Yes, Neumann. You can press the button.” 

The button. Off to one side of the window-wall, pressing it would close the air-gapped controls to the containment cells. Then the system could carry out the predetermined course of action. The fate of an entire species, one of the most advanced in known space, bound to a single button. 

Neumann strided over and pressed it. It wasn’t like he had any other choice—the Upsilon hadn’t given him one. 

He watched on an infodisplay on the window as the steady flow of mass-energy to the containment cell holding the last of the Upsilon cut off. The light from the cell began to fade, shifting red ever so slowly. 

To the captured Upsilon, nothing seemed amiss as it passed through the point of no return. 

To Neumann and the rest of humanity, the image of the cell would remain there, frozen on the event horizon for centuries—a ghost. 

**\>\> The Halls of the Forgotten**  
Six limestone hallways stretched into the tesseract. Six mausoleums, for six dead species, six “everyone-and-everything-you’ve-ever-knowns”, forgotten to the void of time. 

Operating out of the smallest room in the tesseract, it was Hauhet’s job to learn what had been lost, although wrangling with time was no easy feat. Millions of years of geological records had been analyzed thousands of times over hundreds of centuries, an unfathomable amount of information compiled into an additional six rooms worth of results. 

Glancing at the plaques for rooms 2-7, they read:

*The Ruins of New Mongolia, remnants of an enterprising race who almost made it to space. Their civilization lived for 12,045 years.* 

*The Ghosts of the Upsilon, a species of rapid evolution, infinitely adaptable down to their own psychology. Yet the Upsilon couldn’t adapt to humanity. They lasted 4,583 years.* 

*The Architects of Skye. The great monuments of their history stretch a span of 132,057 ± 500 years.*

*Firefly, named after the ancient television franchise. Aged \~33,000 years.* 

*The Terraformers. 68,000 years.* 

*Hyperion, age indeterminate.* 

They were the forgotten ones, history lost to the infinite ocean of time. 

To Hauhet, this endless chaos was her playground; making patterns out of the noise, her passion. 

*Starting wave function collapse 677,903 using latest received states.* 

Then Hauhet turned her attention to the empty, 8th room at the end of the hallways, as she had thousands of times before. She had not been told who it was for. So, she had made the plaque for it herself. 

*Estimated time to completion, 12:36:14*

From the limitless sea of information she would form correlations, among the different species, and then in between them. Iteration after iteration, events were compared, similarities and differences noted, and trends were checked time and again. Her analyses extended far beyond the individual species themselves. 

*Matching states with model…*

It was quite a while ago that Hauhet had started seeing patterns. Some had been interesting. Others had been worrying. One in particular was, as she had put it, *apocalyptic*, for it extended not just in the past, but also past the present, and into the future. 

*Recalculating the Prophecy.* 

Hauhet would breeze through the calculations. Prophecies didn’t change, after all; and so the steps were simple, and the result simpler: a single percentage, the probability that determined if the Prophecy would prove true. The probability that determined if the name on the plaque would join the others in the Halls of the Forgotten. 

Presently Hauhet turned her attention to the plaque, and the name engraved on it, in every language known to man. All of them she could read, and all of them said the same thing: Humanity. 

*Calculation complete. Resulting certainty: 100%*

*Starting wave function collapse 677,904…*

**\>\> Milky Way Galaxy**  
Humanity watched as star after star faded from the night sky. Each one was a billion, ten billion, a hundred billion souls, snuffed out like a candle out of wax. 

With each star Humanity knew a part of themselves died, but they couldn’t feel it. They couldn’t feel what wasn’t there. 

They vaguely remembered a time, long ago when Humanity was on the threshold of the stars, looking up at the universe, waiting to find others like them. Then they came across the Hyterrum Mind, a beautiful flower growing in the void. They had admired it, but eventually, it had faded to the back of their memory; flowers couldn’t talk, after all. 

Then from the shadows of the riverbend came the Upsilon, a prey cornered on their path. They tried to soothe it, to back away, to go around it. But it lashed out, and it had kept fighting, all the way to its death. 

Its corpse had joined the dozens of others strewn across the stars. 

Now they looked down at the galaxy, the galaxy that they had conquered. It was an impressive feat. They had thought themselves on top of the world, beyond the clutches of evolution. 

Now Humanity realized how wrong they were. Civilization was simply an organism, one level in complexity above multicellular life, and they had known all along that multicellular life had evolved 25 times independently. Yet only a few of those 25 lineages survived to form plants, animals, and fungi. It should have been obvious. 

*What happened to the other ones?* 

The dozens of dead civilizations was what had happened. 

Humanity had conquered much, but never once had they conquered evolution, and now it was their turn to cross into the Great Beyond. 

*To join the forgotten.* 

And the last of the stars died out.

***\>\> Starting conscious waveform collapse. Retrieving retrotemporal translations: terms, names, units.*** 

Our universe is 14.2 billion years old. Life has had eons to evolve, take root, and spread across the galaxy. Civilizations could have flourished many times over. The night sky should be filled with the songs of sapience, the waveforms of innovation, the voice of intelligent thought…

Yet when we listen we are met with utter silence in all spectrums of the Electromagnetic Medium. 

**\>\>**   
A lone, winged creature strolled about in front of a striated cliff face, his two manipulator arms tracing over a peculiar band of color. With a wave of his tentacle-like arms the surface of the cliff rippled, its molecules flowing about to his will, and clumps of material freed themselves from the rock and hovered in the air. 

*Silicon, carbon…hmm. Those proportions seem off.* 

He knew, using the abilities gifted to him by evolution, the precise makeup of the cliff wall. What he didn’t know was how it came to be, and the once-great species behind its origin. The species that had called itself Humanity. 

*Sharp upper boundary…huh.* 

Around him stretched a small patch of unfamiliar short green stalks, the only significant lifeform on the dry, alien planet. 

*That's interesting.* 

And the grass swayed in the wind.
