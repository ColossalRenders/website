She would be known as Celeste, and she was a Sculptorid. As she looked up at the great barrier of clear composite and metal latticework keeping the colony of New Nest from the airless void outside, she couldn’t help but despair. 

A flash of light among the stars marked the battle raging in orbit. They were losing. The colony wouldn’t stand for much longer, and Celeste was going to be here to see its end. She glanced out one distant side of the dome at the spaceport on the horizon. The last of the evacuation ships were leaving. She wasn’t going to be on one of them; being the director of New Nest’s interstellar communications department, she had a job to fulfill. She was staying behind to fulfill a promise that her people had once made, a hundred years ago. 

A harsh light briefly filled the sharp shadows the system’s star cast on the colony’s tall buildings. She was currently perched on a high balcony in one of the buildings. The hasty evacuation had been straining the colony’s central air regulation system, and a gentle wind blew past her towards the general direction of the massive hangar-sized airlocks in the direction of the spaceport. She briefly tried to recount how long it had been since she had felt wind. She and her longtime friend Cato had come to New Nest on a colony ship, and they had watched together as the city grew to its current size. 

*Cato*. When the invasion fleet had first been located, he had volunteered to fight for the defenders. Now he was somewhere out there, among the sea of stars, fighting the faceless fleet of invading warships. Another flash lit up the skyline of the colony, and Celeste winced. She spread her wings, feeling the wind, and left off the balcony. She looked up at the fragile sky of glass overhead. Each one of these flashes could have been the end of the brave, bright person that she had known for what seemed like her entire life, and she would never know. She would never know. 

\*\*\* 

He would become infamous as Cato, but right now he was but an officer on a dying battleship. The captain of the ship was yelling orders frantically while Sculptorids scrambled around the command bridge. The Sculptorids communicated telepathically via magnetism, and the room’s fields were filled with a whirlwind of chaotic thoughts and emotions. Cato tuned it out. 

Cato was a mere tactical officer, in charge of the point-defense array. In front of him he flipped through a small booklet. It was a physical book with pages—it was restricted for any ship in contact with the enemy to have digital copies of this book. Every item containing information from the same source as it followed the same policy, and this book was from no ordinary source. A strange alien script was mixed into the waveform notation of the Sculptorids. Cato wasn’t quite sure of the original title of the work, but it was something related to war, and art. 

He looked out the viewport at the front of the bridge. A flash among the stars was the detonation of an enemy missile, whether against a PDC shell or the hull of a spaceship, Cato wasn’t sure. Another flash was the closest ship to them, the behemoth *Zenith*, firing its main railguns. A third flash, followed by a blaring alarm, drew Cato’s attention. 

“Missiles inbound, one hundred count, eta 5 minutes\!” a technician called out, for what seemed like the hundredth time that day. The eta had been getting shorter and shorter as the enemy encroached on the orbit around New Nest. Cato checked, and rechecked the targeting algorithms for the point defense cannons on the ship. They had run out of counter-missiles long before. He glanced at the terminal displaying the number of remaining PDC rounds. 7,706 it said. 

The *Zenith* began to fire its long-range kinetics at the incoming missiles. At this distance Cato could barely make out the ship’s massive radiators glowing red-hot. Cato counted down the seconds before the missiles came into range for their own point defense. Quickly Cato finalized the firing solution for the PDCs and sent them to the targeting computers. 

As the missiles came within range, the magnetically-accelerated PDC cannons came to life. A line of glowing red-hot rounds trailed into the dark void, reaching towards the approaching points of light that were the missiles. The line of red curved, swinging more and more, intersecting with the points of light. One by one, the missiles disappeared under the combined assault of their ship’s PDCs and the *Zenith*. 

Then it ended as the last missile was destroyed. Cato glanced again at the PDC round counter. 7,164, it read. 

He quietly thanked the people who wrote the targeting algorithms. 

Then he heard a spike of alarm in the telepathic maelstrom of the bridge. 

“Cryogenic missiles inbound\! ETA 15 seconds\!” 

Cato felt his blood run cold. Quickly he changed the PDC’s targeting mode from thermal to radar. The PDCs blazed to life yet again, and he felt the main drives burn as he was pressed into his perch. 

Thankfully there were only a few missiles headed for their ship. The *Zenith* wasn’t so lucky. Cato watched as the massive ship, from this distance a small silhouette glowing red at the back end, changed from its long-distance railguns to closer range PDC cannons. Eight brilliant streaks of red streamed out from the ship, reaching frantically for the approaching missiles. Three were destroyed nearly immediately. The streaks arced through the night. Five more flashes followed. The ship’s massive drive blazed, pushing it frantically into a lower and lower orbit in an attempt to evade the missiles. Another six missiles sailed past the ship, not hitting much. 

Two missiles struck the ship. One impacted on a radiator fin, shattering the delicate construction in half. One struck the front bridge, tearing through the spinal mounted railgun and the reactor, and exiting the other end. 

There were no escape pods to be seen. Having inadvertently deorbited itself in the maneuver, the ship drifted slowly downwards towards the rocky surface of the planet below. 

\*\*\* 

Celeste was running out of time. As she glided out from the last datacenter, she turned towards her final task. She had to get to the radio antennas at the edge of the colony. Suddenly the horizon turned to day. Startled, she tumbled a few meters through the air, before reorienting herself, trying to locate the source of the flash. It wasn’t hard to find. On the horizon, like a colossal shard of broken glass, a ship several kilometers in length had embedded itself in the rocky surface of the planet. The air vibrated with a low rumble as the shockwave finally traveled through the crust of the planet and reached the city. The skyscrapers around her wobbled precariously. The lights on multiple buildings went out. Alarms blared out from all around her. 

Celeste recognized that ship. She had been there when they received the schematics over the interstellar radio link. In fact, she had been the one who oversaw the transfer of its design from the Interstellar Communications department to the Scultorid defense forces. She remembered wondering why anyone might need a ship of such proportions, but now she just watched as one after another they fell from the sky. 

She hastened her pace. She didn’t have much time, and she had to make sure not a single trace of *them* remained on the hundreds of thousands of digital storage devices around the colony. It was the least that her people could do. 

Celeste was not alive when the sculptorids had first established contact with another intelligent species among the stars. That was a hundred years before her own time. She had grown up with the presence of the radio transmissions that came nonstop from a very specific star 45.2 light years away. The transmissions were what had inspired her to become the head of New Nest’s department of interstellar communications. She wanted to be the first, after those on the Sculptorid homeworld itself, to see the images, to listen to the news updates, to read the literature, to watch the entertainment of a whole other species, days before their official release to the public. 

And now the radio dishes picked up nothing but silence. Of course, that was at their own insistence. The Sculptorids had already gained so much from the transmissions; without them they would not have stood a chance against the invading fleet. Even now, they didn’t stand much of a chance, but if their own people were going down, it was the least they could do to make sure that their ally, the Humans, will survive. 

And that was Celeste’s job. To fulfill a promise, once made by her people to another. A promise that the humans had held up with everything they could, and it was time now for the Scultorids to hold their end of it. Celeste glided down and came to a stop at the entrance to the receiving radio station. 

\*\*\* 

The enemy was close now. 

The former chaos on the bridge had fallen to sporadic commands from the captain and the unending stream of warnings shouted by the sensor technicians. The entire bridge had been evacuated of atmosphere, and everyone was dressed in stifling vacuum suits that were a bit too tight around the wings. 

Without the *Zenith* providing supporting fire, the enemy had been approaching even faster than before. They came with the cold efficiency of a machine, and for what anyone knew, that might be exactly what they were. Waves after waves of missiles came, one replacing another as it was shot down, at just the right rate to push them back while the invaders focused on destroying the larger ships. 

Cato was frantically trying to optimize the firing pattern while the ship’s pilot jerked the ship about, trying to avoid the densest of the missiles. A burst of acceleration threw Cato to the side, where he was caught by a mesh of flexible webbing and violently thrown back before his terminal. He continued his work. The stars spun in the viewport at the front of the bridge. As the pilot fired the thrusters yet again, veering the ship to the side, Cato quickly adjusted the firing solution, sweeping the PDCs across a patch of missiles in their path, taking out five of them. Another ten more quickly followed. At the edge of his vision Cato saw the counter of PDC ammunition drop past the 5000 mark and into the 4000’s. 

Somewhere ahead of them one of their own ships took a missile directly to the antimatter storage and briefly showered the rest of the defending fleet with gamma rays. 

Several missiles passed through the debris field that used to be the ship. Cato prepared to shoot them down, since they were the closest ship on the missile’s trajectory. However, the missiles began to accelerate the other direction, down towards the planet, towards…

*“No\!”* Cato cried, “they’re targeting the colony\!” 

“What about it?” The captain retorted, “there’s no one down there\!” 

“Please\!” Cato exclaimed. “There—the last ships are still taking off—” Because no one else cared about the one person still in the colony itself, except him. 

There was no response, but as the ship veered to dodge another cluster of missiles, it kept going down the gravity well and towards the planet. Cato frantically came up with a firing solution for the PDCs. They were not designed to operate at this range, but the missiles likely didn’t have much delta-v left at this point, meaning they couldn’t dodge the PDC rounds for long. 

“Celeste, I’ve got you,” he whispered as the PDCs opened fire. 

Streams of red streaked out towards the planet. Cato watched as six points of light appeared, one after another, as the missiles activated their drives. The PDC fire missed, but hitting the missiles themselves was never the point. Cato re-oriented the PDCs, feeding them a new firing solution, and they opened fire again, keeping the missiles moving as they tried to avoid the stream of projectiles. One of the missiles went dark, its fuel spent. 

“Missile one ballistic,” one of the sensor technicians commented. A burst of PDC fire quickly took it out. 

Cato refocused his attention on the remaining missiles. One after the other, two more missiles were spent and destroyed, leaving just three. That was when the sensor technician spoke up again. 

“Missiles incoming\! 23 count, ETA 1 minute\!” 

Cato froze. His logical mind told him to target the missiles going for their ship and leave the remaining three for the colony’s anti-orbital defenses. His subconscious told him that the anti-orbit defenses stood no chance, and that *Celeste was down there, she’s down there right now, I can’t let this happen—* 

Cato glanced at the captain. 

“Carry on, whatcha looking at me for?” the captain asked with a knowing smirk. 

Cato gave him a silent thanks, then turned his attention back to the 3 remaining missiles. Allocating one of the four PDCs to defend against the incoming missiles, he resumed his assault on the remaining missiles with the other three PDCs. One of the missiles soon blinked out. Another followed soon after. The third sailed out of the engagement range of the PDCs after having expended most of its fuel, but Cato was certain now that the colony’s defenses would be able to shoot it down. 

He quickly turned the three PDCs to join the fourth in destroying the incoming missiles. They were barely twenty seconds away now, and only a few had been shot down. 

He glanced at the PDC round counter. It was just over 3000\. He increased the fire rate of the PDCs, sacrificing ammunition efficiency for a higher hit rate. The lights on the bridge went out as the ship’s power budget was redirected fully to weapons and propulsion. Twelve of the original 23 missiles remained now. If there still had been atmosphere on the bridge, the temperature would be becoming unbearably hot now as the ship’s radiators struggled to radiate all of the waste heat from the ship. The missiles were ten seconds away. The world pressed down on Cato as the ship went to full thrust. Nine missiles remained. They were five seconds away. The PDC round counter plunged down in a blur as the streaks of red projectiles waved about wildly, trying and struggling to hit anything. Four missiles remained. They were two seconds away. Each PDC tracked its own missile. Cato’s vision was blacking out from the acceleration. Three of the missiles missed. The PDCs swung to intercept the fourth. The lines of red converged to a point, before an object appeared in the center of the glowing red crosshair, and the missile punched straight through one side of the bridge, tearing across the space, and out the other side. 

\*\*\* 

Celeste ran through the corridors of the radio facility. Passing by a window, she briefly stopped to look outside. Streaks of white-hot kinetic projectiles were rising from all around the dome, towards a point in the sky, glowing the bright purple of the defensive UV-band lasers. They were the anti-orbit defenses. That could mean only one thing, Celeste decided, the enemy was beginning to target the colony itself. The fleet had lost. Cato had lost. 

She wanted to stop right there, drop to the floor, and cry, but instead she turned away and continued running down the corridors. She had a job to complete. The sound of claws on metal echoed through the halls. Pushing past a set of doors, she emerged into the datacenter of the facility. Quickly, she disconnected the power to all of the storage drives. None of the drives were designed to be solid state, but just as a precaution she then found a canister of highly reactive oxidizer and set fire to the entire room. Quickly closing the doors behind her as the very metal of the walls began to combust, Celeste jumped out of the building and glided across to the building housing the radio transmitter itself. 

She quickly found her way through the familiar corridors to the transmission terminals. Slowing down as she entered the control room, she looked around at the terminals, arranged in neat rows. She ran her wings over one of the terminals, remembering when this room had been filled with Sculptorids. She remembered putting together transmissions and sending them out into the void towards the human homeworld. She looked out the large window at the front at the stars above. Rows after rows of radio dishes were arranged on the barren, rocky surface. Each one was pointing haphazardly in a random direction. It was a strange sight. Usually they were all pointing in the same direction, at a very particular point in the night sky. A point that Celeste found easily, picking it out as a faint star among the millions of other stars studding the sky. 

It had been perhaps eight years since the last transmission had arrived. Eight solid years of depressing silence. Celeste wasn’t sure what the humans were up to now. Back then they were still babbling away about a plan to eventually send a ship to the Sculptorid homeworld. Now it just seemed like a faraway childhood dream. Celeste just hoped that they would never have to endure the same fate as her species. 

Celeste moved back from the window and walked to the terminal responsible for targeting the array. Flipping a switch, she turned on the terminal. This was the last physical object on the colony of New Nest that contained the coordinates of the Sculptorid homeworld, outside of their own minds; she had personally made sure of that. She navigated through the interface, the computer responding to her mental commands, until she found the option she was looking for. It was the option to purge all data from the facility’s database of celestial objects. 

“Sorry we couldn’t do more,” she whispered, as if the humans could hear her. She had always wanted to meet a human face-to-face; who didn’t, they were an entire alien civilization after all. But now they’d be lucky enough to live to see another day. Bracing herself at the confirmation dialogue asking if she *really* wanted to purge the entire database, she told herself that it wouldn’t make any difference either way, that the data on the computer was just that—data. And it was. It wouldn’t make any difference besides protecting the humans if she went forward with this, but somehow, it felt like a monumental task. It felt final. It was like the period that would end the sentence. 

“Goodbye,” she said, then selected the confirm option. There was a brief loading bar as the database was purged, and then it was done. 

That was it. That was everything. Celeste left the control room and strolled out into the empty tree-lined walkways of the city. This was the end. 

\*\*\* 

When Cato came to, all was silent save for the faint pulsing of an alarm. He opened his eyes. Bits of broken metal composites floated in front of him, along with several Sculptorids in vacuum suits. Cato couldn’t tell if they were still alive. Beyond the destruction was a thick, star-filled rift where the missile had entered the ship. The pilot’s station as well as the captain’s were all gone, either reduced to slag or floating all around Cato, along with an entire half of the bridge. 

Sparks flashed sporadically from somewhere within the mess. The ship still had power. That meant the lower decks, containing most of the ship’s critical components as well as the escape pods were likely unharmed. 

Cato himself was surprisingly unharmed. With a bit of force, he tore himself out from the tangled web that had held him in place during acceleration. Kicking off his spot, he floated to the closest body. He recognized them as one of the sensor technicians. Shaking him urgently, the technician groggily opened his eyes. 

“Whu-huh—I’m alive?” the technician muttered. “Am I alive?” 

“Yes you’re alive, now go down and get into the escape pods, the ship is done for. Go, hurry\!” At Cato’s encouragement, the sensor technician disappeared down a hatch to the lower decks. Cato repeated that with the rest of the Sculptorids who were still alive. Many weren’t, but Cato couldn’t care too much about them now. 

As the last crew member left the destroyed bridge, Cato prepared to follow before something stopped him. Floating over to the rift torn out by the missile, Cato looked outside at the crescent limb of the planet below, shining conveniently through the gap. 

“Celeste,” he whispered, “Celeste where are you…” 

Cato found his way over to the closest still-functioning terminal and pecked at the buttons to awaken it. After several moments, the terminal booted up into the ship’s backup system. The main computers had been placed near the front near the crewed section, away from the highly radioactive antimatter drives at the rear of the ship, and had likely been destroyed when the missile blew clean through the nose of the ship. 

Cato had to clumsily use the physical buttons to navigate the interface, but after a bit he managed to bring up the real-time map of the system. What he saw made him suck in a breath. A few things were immediately apparent. They were losing, badly. The attacking fleet had several ships already in orbit. The colony’s defenses were in full force, blasting down the occasional missile that got through the dwindling defending fleet, trying to defend the last evacuation ship that was still preparing for take off. Cato traced the missiles back to an enemy missile carrier, heavily guarded by a force of over a dozen ships. 

And Cato couldn’t do anything about it. He couldn’t do anything for the colony, for the thousands on that evac ship, for Celeste. His own ship—he realized that he was in command now, being the only living being left on the ship—had drifted far into the enemy ranks, or perhaps the enemy had overtaken his former position, he wasn’t sure which. But the result was that he was surrounded by enemy ships. The only reason he was still alive was because the enemy didn’t see the ship as any sort of threat. 

He was surrounded by enemy ships. A memory spoke out to him, a short quote that he remembered reading in a specific, paper booklet. 

*“In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.”*

He had an opportunity here. He looked at the map again. The missile carrier had just passed his own ship, at just over 1000km away, outside of PDC range but well within missile range. But the ship didn’t have any missiles left. It didn’t have anything left other than PDC rounds, antimatter, and propellant. 

Cato needed a new plan. The ship he was now in command of could accelerate at 100m/s/s. The carrier was heavily guarded, but mainly from the front, and he was behind it now. He glanced at the ammo count for the PDCs. There were still just over 2500 rounds left. The front, nose-mounted PDC was gone, but the remaining three mounted on the side of the ship were still functional. 

There was only one thing he could do now. He might not have any missiles, but he had something even more powerful. He had a whole ship. Fumbling around the primitive interface of the backup system, he warmed up the drive of the ship, prepared firing solutions for the three remaining PDCs, and took a deep breath. He would need to move fast. The moment he started the main drive, the moment he did anything, really, the enemy would rain hell upon his ship. 

Ensuring everything was ready, Cato reseated himself in acceleration webbing. And with the peck of a button, the main drive blazed to life. Grabbing a joystick in his beak, he steered the ship straight on towards the missile carrier. The acceleration pushed him back with the force of just over five times the gravity of his home planet. 

Instantly, points of light streamed out from the distant carrier as it started firing missiles. With another button, Cato activated the PDCs at full firerate. There was no point conserving ammunition now. He watched as the first missiles approached quickly, then clumsily threw the ship into a series of random zig-zagging movements. Most of the missiles flew right past his ship, unable to properly maneuver at what was essentially point-blank range. The rest were shot down by the PDCs. He watched as the carrier began to accelerate itself, although its mass didn’t allow it much agility. He watched as the carrier approached him, or rather he approached the carrier. 

He was just 500 km from the carrier now, and approaching fast. The missiles were getting a bit too close to his ship for his liking. He quickly tried to recall the procedure for proper evasive maneuvers. 

“Uhh, let’s see, reactor to open-cycle cooling, dump all excess propellant, main drive to high thrust low isp mode…” A blaring alarm made Cato throw the ship sideways once more, and the missile that was about to cleave clean through the ship instead burnt up in the exhaust plume of the main drive. 

At just 200 km, the enemy ship began to fire kinetics. One of them clipped one of the two radiators on the ship, and the main drives shut off to prevent turning itself into molten metal. It didn’t matter though. The job was done. Cato quickly got out of his acceleration webbing, tumbled through the hatch to the lower decks. The ship shuddered as another round impacted it somewhere. The lights blinked, but stayed on. Cato fumbled his way into an escape pod. It was one of those fancy ones with a high-acceleration rated cryopod. As the ship shuddered once more and the lights outside finally blinked out, Cato activated the automated eject sequence, worked his way out of the vacuum suit, and climbed into the cryopod. The lid closed over him, and he felt the burst of acceleration as the pod shot out from the ship, now sailing on a collision course with the enemy missile carrier. 

*This is it*, he thought. *I’m in an escape pod, in the middle of enemy forces, our fleet is losing. This is the end. At least I saved that last ship.* 

The last thing he felt before the drugs kicked in was the slight vibrations as his pod passed through the debris cloud that used to be a missile carrier. 

\*\*\* 

The sky was about to fall, in a quite literal sense. All it would take is for one missile to make the entire dome come crashing down. Celeste watched as the last evac ship lifted off, shooting up towards the night. The colony’s defenses had slowed a bit as the barrage of missiles had lessened; still, the night was lit by streams of projectiles and several purple dots glowed among the stars. 

Celeste glided among the rooftops of the city’s skyscrapers in silence. She was headed for the disaster bunker in the middle of the city, although not because she thought it would do anything. The bunker was designed for critical failures of the dome or other colony infrastructure, not a full scale invasion by an intelligent force. She told herself that she was heading there because she had been told to. It was the last item on her list of objectives given to her before everyone else had left. 

She told herself that it was *not* because that still, some part of her clung onto the hope that maybe one day she’ll see her friend again, because as much as she tried to convince herself otherwise, she could not put out the futile hope that maybe everything would turn out alright. 

A tumbling missile, glowing red hot from the defensive lasers, shot out of the star-filled night and struck a glancing blow on the dome, skipping off to embed itself in the rocky surface beyond. Half a second later a reverberating thud rang out throughout the city. 

Celeste picked up her pace and landed on the rooftop of the deserted building that used to house the seat of government on the colony. In the central courtyard before her was the entrance to the disaster bunker. She glided down to it and opened the heavy metal doors, revealing the elevating platform beyond. 

Stepping inside, Celeste turned around and looked up, out at the star filled sky. The hundreds of new points of light and frequent flashes made it an alien sight, but underneath it all Celeste recognized the familiar constellations that she had known all her life. Some things would always remain the same. A million years before her people existed the stars looked just like this, and they will still look like this a million years after they are gone. She had always known this as a fact, but now she faced it as a reality. Life was but a transient event. A small curiosity in the grand scope of space and time. 

Against such powers, what chance did they stand? Hoping that the end wouldn’t come was like wishing for a miracle. 

And right now, Celeste really wished for a miracle. A miracle where she was still with Cato, where she would get to fly across the blue sky of an alien world, where she could just live with the people—the one person that she loved—without death hanging over their heads. But miracles didn’t exist. 

There were dozens of purple dots among the stars now. The anti-orbital railguns were frantically switching between targets, trying to get each before they hit the vulnerable dome of the colony. They had been doing that for almost an hour now, far longer than any military engineer could have hoped for. But even they had limits. One of the missiles struck one of the railguns in a blazing ball of fire, and as a second struck the dome, shattering an entire tile into a billion pieces that exploded outwards, Celeste closed the bunker doors, and the elevating platform quickly plunged down into the ground, several blast doors closing overhead along the way. 

Down in the dim corridors of the lifeless bunker, Celeste found the closest bay of cryopods, climbed inside one of them, and closed the lid over herself. Slowly, the world faded to black. 

\*\*\*

Darkness. 

*Where…* 

Cold. 

The entire world was so incredibly cold. 

*What…*

Celeste wasn’t sure what was happening. Faintly she heard alarms in the distance. She didn’t know where she was, *when* it was. All she remembered was streams of fire over the sky, and a face, familiar yet distant, that brought to her both joy and sadness at the same time. 

*What happened? Did we win? Did Cato find me?* 

Suddenly light filled her vision. Instinctively she tried to close her eyes, except they were already closed. She heard a hissing sound. It was the sound of a cryopod opening, but the sound was strange. It was too close, almost like she was the one in the cryopod…

The overhead battle. The bunker. The dome collapsing. Celeste remembered. Not all of it, and she wasn’t quite fully awake yet, but enough to understand that whatever was happening shouldn’t have been happening. It was impossible. There was no way they could have won, no way that someone was coming to rescue her. 

She heard sounds. Strange, vocal sounds, like the calls of an animal, but somehow more…refined. 

*“Holy shit\! This one’s alive\! Guys, we have a live alien over here\!”* 

Somewhere in the back of her mind Celeste remembered something about sound and communication, but it passed just as quickly as it came. 

*“What do we do? We can’t just leave them here\!”* 

There was only one explanation. The enemy had found the bunker. They had found her. Celeste didn’t know what they were going to do, but she didn’t want to find out. 

*“Whatever we’re doing we need to do it fast, the launch window closes in two hours. Do we even have enough space on the ship?”* 

*“Team 2 insists there is. You know they found another one up there.”* 

Celeste wasn’t sure what was happening, but whatever it was she couldn’t allow it to happen. She couldn’t let the enemy take her. For all she knew, they could rip the coordinates for the human homeworld straight from her brain. She felt something grab her on the wings. She tried to kick back, blindly thrashing her talons about, trying to hit something, anything. 

*“Woah there, big guy, or gal, I can’t tell. Calm down\!”* 

Celeste felt a prick in her neck, and her movements slowed. Suddenly feeling incredibly tired, she felt her consciousness start to slip away again. 

*“Whatever the heck were you doing down here all alone? Don’t worry, you big bird. We got ya.”* 

\*\*\*

Celeste woke up. She felt senses gradually returning to her limbs. She was lying on some sort of soft surface, with what seemed like blankets draped over her. Slowly she cracked open an eye, trying not to alert whoever her capturers were that she was awake. She was in a brightly lit, white room, lying on a platform of some sort, with what seemed like medical equipment besides it. She couldn’t sense any living being around her. The magnetic fields in the room were calm, almost nonexistent except for a slight gradient that felt somewhat similar to that of a spaceship’s reactor. 

Where was she? Her surroundings didn’t feel like a prison cell, but perhaps she was in a laboratory of some sort. Yeah, that was probably right. Cautiously, she tried to look around without turning her head. There didn’t seem to be anything moving in the room. That was when she heard a door open, and strange sounding footsteps enter the room, accompanied by the same strange sounds that she had heard in that brief scene in the bunker. 

“Oh hey there, you’re finally awake.” 

Celeste didn’t understand what the strange sounds meant, but she was fully awake now and could recognize it as communication. *Didn’t the humans also use sound to communicate?* she thought. She tried to look towards the source of the sounds, but she couldn’t see the being from this angle without moving her head. 

Suddenly there was a crack and a brief pulse of magnetism that was unpleasant but not painful. 

“Hello?” the thing spoke, and this time the words carried meaning. “Is this thing working? Do you understand me?” 

Celeste debated whether to respond, or keep pretending to be asleep, but decided that they probably knew she was awake anyways and there was no point in trying to hide that fact. Slowly, she spoke, while straining to push herself up to see her interrogator with slightly atrophied muscles. 

“Yes I can understand you, what do you want—” She froze mid-sentence when she saw the being. She recognized it. She had been studying them for much of her life. It was a human. “What—?”

Way too many thoughts entered her mind all at once. Why was there a human here? Were they working with the enemy? Were they a prisoner just like her? Had the humans been found? How long had it been since the battle of New Nest? Was she on a human ship? Did they have Cato as well? 

“Oh, sorry\! I forgot to introduce myself. I’m, uh, I don’t think names translate very well into electromagnetic telepathy, but my name’s Connor, I’m a human, and you are on the human ship *ISFV Dark Current*. We are currently two light days away from the star of the New Nest system. I gotta say, this must be a shock to you, waking up on an alien ship, talking to an alien being, after having been in cryo for so long.” 

“It is,” Celeste replied with a hint of suspicion. “What happened? Why am I on a human ship? Why are humans even here? This should not be possible\!”

“It shouldn’t,” the human agreed, “but when we first received the news of an invasion on our allies, multiple prominent powers came together to make it possible. The journey took 60 years. The rest of the fleet is at the Sculptorid homeworld—” 

“There’s a fleet?” Celeste interrupted, incredulous. 

“Oh yeah; we had to do a relativistic slingshot around a star to hide our approach vector from the enemy, but they’re setting up a defense right now. No one knows how it’ll play out, but the higher ups seem to have a plan. Unfortunately…we didn’t arrive in time to save your colony. We were two years late…and now all we can do is try and pick up the pieces.” The human sighed. “Oh yeah, that brings me to something. What should we call you?” 

Celeste wanted to ask more, but she put down her curiosity for the time being and tried to recall her knowledge of human names and naming schemes. “Call me Celeste,” she replied. 

“Great, nice to meet you, Celeste. Now I can’t help but ask, why were you alone in a bunker when everyone else left? And did you happen to be awake during the battle? We don’t know much about what happened, currently our only first hand source is a tactical officer of a small ship who was in a dying escape pod when we found him.” 

“I was the head of interstellar communications for New Nest. I was left behind to make sure all traces of the coordinates for your homeworld were destroyed. Now who is this officer that you speak of? May I see him?” Celeste had felt her heart rate increase when the human mentioned that detail. *It couldn’t be…* she thought.

The human seemed just as surprised. “Not possible…” he muttered. “Someone get the other Sulptorid in here\! Quick\!” 

There was the sound of footsteps outside, followed by talons on metal. A mental voice came from the corridor outside, approaching quickly. It was a familiar voice, the clear mental presence of a Sculptorid rather than the muffled, emotionless feel of the human’s translators. It was a voice that Celeste would recognize anywhere. 

A face poked into the room. “Celeste?” the voice asked, full of hope but also apprehension. 

“Cato?” Celeste gasped. 

“Celeste\!” Cato rushed into the room. Celeste tried to stand up on the medbay bed to greet him but was knocked back down when Cato jumped on and brought her into an embrace. “This is real. You’re here\! You’re alive\!” 

“I could say the same for you, you brave, noble—” 

“—do you know, I flew a spaceship into an enemy carrier\! That was the coolest thing I’ve ever done\!” 

“You *what\!*” Celeste cried out. “Don’t you dare ever leave my side again, ever\!” 

Cato laughed. “Yes, *your highness*.” 

“Shut up. I’m not even much of anyone anymore. Can’t be head of Interstellar Communications if the department no longer exists.” The mood sobered a little at that comment. Celeste looked at the human, who had resigned himself to quietly watching from a corner. “Where are you taking us?” she asked. 

The human smiled. “Why, we’re going to Earth.”
