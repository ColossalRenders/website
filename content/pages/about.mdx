## Hi! I'm ColossalRenders... 

This is a website that I made in order to better present my fiction and art, among other things. 

[My Reddit, where I post my stories](https://reddit.com/user/colossalrenders)

### What to expect on this site: 
 - Stories, mostly sci-fi but with some fantasy planned. Currently most of my fiction are short stories, but I expect that to change soon as I start writing longer-form content. Note that not all my stories on Reddit will make it onto this website, especially my less serious stories that I write in between my other ones. 
 - Art, mostly 3d renders done in Blender, often accompanying my writing. Expect many renders of space, spaceships, and spaceships in space. 
 - Other tidbits I might decide to add. 

### What this website is NOT: 
 - A blog site. 
 - A portfolio. (Subject to change, but the primary purpose of this site will remain what is stated above)

## Who am I? 
I'm just some guy with a passion for telling stories in any mediumâ€”it just so happens that writing is one of the most accessible mediums. I'm also a hobbyist 3D artist with decent experience in Blender, specializing in the shader nodetree and box/hard surface modeling (I've never touched the sculpting tab, literally). Of course that's not all, but enough about me; after all, this website is supposed to be about my works, not myself.
